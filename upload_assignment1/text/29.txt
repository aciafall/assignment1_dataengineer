It has embarked on a new journey to build a strong nation and advance national rejuvenation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization.Xi said China this year has coordinated COVID-19 response with economic and social development, worked to ensure both development and security, and actively promoted sustained economic recovery, among others.He went on to cite some more "hard-earned and heartening" progress achieved so far this year -- the economy is on an overall recovery trajectory, grain harvests can be expected, people's lives have been improved, and social stability has been maintained, among others.Noting that there are still many risks and challenges on the journey ahead, Xi stressed greater efforts to strengthen macro regulation, expand effective domestic demand, stimulate the vitality of business entities, keep promoting sustained economic recovery, work to continuously improve social expectations, and forestall and defuse major risks."We should strive to meet this year's economic and social development targets," Xi said.Xi also emphasized continuing to deepen reform and opening up across the board, steadily expanding institutional opening up with regard to rules, regulations, management and standards, promoting the high-quality development of the Belt and Road Initiative, smoothing the positive interplay between domestic and international economic flows to make economic development more resilient and vigorous.The Chinese president said that work should be done to boost employment, help those in difficulties, advance rural revitalization, and achieve solid progress in common prosperity.The principle of "one country, two systems" should be implemented fully, faithfully and firmly, Xi said, pledging support to help Hong Kong and Macao actively participate in developing the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and ensure Hong Kong and Macao's long-term prosperity and stability.Stressing adherence to the one-China principle and the 1992 Consensus, Xi called for promoting the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations. No force can block the realization of the motherland's complete reunification, he added.Xi underscored upholding peace and development, practicing true multilateralism, advancing the implementation of the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, and building a global community of shared future, to create a better future for humankind.Accompanied by jubilant music, guests at the reception raised their glasses to extend congratulations to the 74th founding anniversary of the PRC. â– The Communist Party of China and state leaders Xi Jinping, Li Qiang, Zhao Leji, Wang Huning, Cai Qi, Ding Xuexiang, Li Xi and Han Zheng attend a grand reception to celebrate the 74th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China together with around 800 Chinese and foreign guests at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, capital of China, Sept. 28, 2023.
