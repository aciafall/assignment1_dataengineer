A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while a reading below 50 reflects contraction.   This is the first time since April the PMI for China's manufacturing sector has surged above 50, following four consecutive months of growth, according to the NBS.   NBS statistician Zhao Qinghe noted that there has been an overall improvement in the manufacturing climate.   Among the 21 surveyed industries, 11 reported expansion in September, the data showed.   Saturday's data also revealed that non-manufacturing PMI came in at 51.7 in September, standing above the boom-or-bust line.   China's composite PMI stood at 52 in September, indicating that overall production at manufacturing and non-manufacturing enterprises has continued to expand, Zhao said.  â–
