It then spread the strike to 38 GM and Stellantis parts distribution centers around the country on Sept. 22, following a failure in making meaningful progress in new contract negotiations.According to the latest updates from the company and the union, Ford has offered a 20-percent wage increase over the four years of the contract, job security the UAW had sought, the restoration of cost-of-living adjustments, an enhanced profit-sharing formula, the elimination of a tiered wage, the immediate conversion of temporary workers to permanent status, and cutting the time it takes for permanent full-time workers to reach the top of the wage scale from eight years to four.GM and Stellantis have made similar wage offers. The union initially demanded 46-percent in compounded wage increase over four years and has since reduced its request to 36 percent without compounding. â– Auto workers take part in a strike outside a Ford assembly plant in the southern suburbs of Chicago, Illinois, the United States, on Sept. 29, 2023.
